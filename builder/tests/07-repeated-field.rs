// The std::process::Command builder handles args in a way that is potentially
// more convenient than passing a full vector of args to the builder all at
// once.
//
// Look for a field attribute #[builder(each = "...")] on each field. The
// generated code may assume that fields with this attribute have the type Vec
// and should use the word given in the string literal as the name for the
// corresponding builder method which accepts one vector element at a time.
//
// In order for the compiler to know that these builder attributes are
// associated with your macro, they must be declared at the entry point of the
// derive macro. Otherwise the compiler will report them as unrecognized
// attributes and refuse to compile the caller's code.
//
//     #[proc_macro_derive(Builder, attributes(builder))]
//
// These are called inert attributes. The word "inert" indicates that these
// attributes do not correspond to a macro invocation on their own; they are
// simply looked at by other macro invocations.
